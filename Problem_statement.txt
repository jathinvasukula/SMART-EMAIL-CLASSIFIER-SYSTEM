Smart Email Classifier System

Problem: Build an AI system that automatically categorizes incoming emails (spam/ham, priority levels, or departments).

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and train a classification model (Naive Bayes or SVM)

Critical Thinking: Analyze which features matter most for email classification, handle class imbalance

Problem Solving: Deal with text preprocessing challenges, choose appropriate algorithms

Modular Structure: Separate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction modules

Clear Architecture: Design clean pipeline from raw email → preprocessed text → features → prediction

Deliverable: Python script with modular functions that can classify new emails with confidence scores.
